I am proud to announce that Origoss Solutions has joined the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

CNCF is an open source software foundation dedicated to making cloud native computing universal and sustainable. Cloud native computing uses an open source software stack to deploy applications as microservices, packaging each part into its own container, and dynamically orchestrating those containers to optimize resource utilization. Cloud native technologies enable software developers to build and deploy great products faster.

As a member of the CNCF and as a Kubernetes Certified Service Provider, we help our customers in their successful cloud native transformation, leveraging our several decades of experience in consulting, developing, supporting legacy network and IT system operation. #cncf #kcsp #kubernetes
